<p>One of our key innovations is the Machine Learning and Experimentation Platform (MAEPL). MAEPL empowers users to run better experiments and seamlessly transform them into models. It establishes standardized data contracts across ML, experimentation, distribution, permutation, combination, etc. This abstraction allows consumers to focus on their work without worrying about its complexities. MAEPL also makes it easy for us to upgrade to the model easily.</p>
<p>We have also developed the Analytics Platform Ecosystem (APE), a suite of tools and libraries designed to streamline our ML workflows and support model building and deployment. APE simplifies workflows for Data Scientists while enabling analytics to scale effectively and meet business needs.</p>
<p>MAEPL and APE have enabled possibilities and growth previously impossible in business.</p>
